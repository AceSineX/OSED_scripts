# OSED_scripts

This is a collection of scripts I wrote during OSED preparation. They are QoL stuff that provide sanity checks, and are designed to make you more efficient.

Currently only bad/mangled character checking scripts are here.
> badcharscheck.py <- automate the checking of the output of windbg when sending all chars. Good sanity check, good for mangled chars. 

> payloadcheck.py <- You sent your payload but didn't receive a shell. Sanity check that your payload is intact.
